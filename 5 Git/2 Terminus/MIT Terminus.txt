You go up to the pony and attempt to ride it. It compiles and you ride the pony around in 
circles for a bit. It then grows tired of having you as a burden and knocks you off. He 
then looks towards the east as if suggesting that you head in that direction.

eventually leads you to the entrance of a cave. Sitting right outside this cave is an

You speak with the old man. He greets you warmly as if you were old friends. You feel 
at ease with him.  
"Hello adventurer! Top of the morning to you! You seem like a young and energetic 
explorer. If you're brave enough, your destiny awaits within this cave. That destiny 
will manifest itself as a portal. Enter this portal and begin the next chapter of your 
life." 
The old man sees the shock on your face and smiles a comforting smile, "I am but a 
fragile old man, and cannot accompany you through this cave, but what I can provide are 
a few simple spells that will help you along your way. Just read my old manuscripts and 
tryout those spells." 
>less OldManuscripts
If you ever forget a spell just use"help" and a list of available spells will appear. 
If you need details on how to use a specific spell, use 'man' followed by spell 
command. For example, if you were interested in details on how to use the "mv" spell 
you would use: man mv

"Excuse me," you begin. The man turns, startled. "Oh, hello! Welcome to Terminus. 
You'll have to forgive me, but we're all a little on edge lately, what with the Dark 
Wizard spreading corruption all along the coast.  You should be careful!" 
>less RandomCitizen2
The man looks up from his newspaper when he notices you staring. "Have you read this?" 
he exclaims, shaking the latest edition of "The Last Word" in your face. "It says here 
the wizard's corruption has spread as far as Oston to the south, and New Console is 
completely unrecoverable! These are dangerous times," he mutters, shaking his head and 
turning back to his reading.

The woman is sobbing uncontrollably, her face in her hands. "My baby," she cries, "They 
kidnapped my baby! I just know that wizard had something to do with it."

"What happened? You DARE to ask-- you know perfectly well what happened. Your friends, 
the wizard's minions, destroyed my house and kidnapped my poor daughter, that's what! 
My wife even went into town to look for help, and I haven't heard from her since!"  
 
"Hm? Well, I guess it's true that you don't look like one of the wizard's minions. 
Still, I don't trust you magicfolk. If you really are who you say you are, then prove 
your good intentions by making me a new House!"

You've learned how to make use of your friend grep I see. If you haven't it might be 
wise for you to go back to the Library again to do some reading. Because here, you'll 
need to use him to help you. Here is your task:  
There are a lot of items in the MoreKernelFiles room and one of them contains the sudo 
password. This password is very powerful password that lets you do absolutely anything 
in the world. It lets you cast a spell on any item that is protected in any way. You 
know the password is contained in one of these .txt items. You know that it appears on 
a line that says the word: 'password='. You should find it with grep's help. Then 
you'll need to use the sudo spell to find Paradise. To do this, just Type 'sudo' before 
the command you want to run, like so: 'sudo cp ITEM_A ITEM_B'. You will then be 
prompted for the sudo password. Type the password, and the spell that comes after sudo 
will be cast. If you open the Certificate in Paradise with sudo, you will have truly 
found Paradise.
